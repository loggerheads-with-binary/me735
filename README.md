# Code Base 
### Course Project for ME 735, IIT Bombay 
A repository for all the source code, tests, static files and other relevant data/files for the ME 735(Computer Graphics and Product Modelling) project 

# Algorithms Used 
1. L1 Camera Trajectory Stabilization Algorithm 
2. Point Feature Moving Average Stabilization Algorithm 
3. Feature Spline Smoothing Stabilization Algorithm 

The above algorithms have been cascaded amongst each other for all possible permutations and combinations to obtain the best possible results.

For test, we have used the two videos `static.mp4` and `dynamic.mp4` in `data-src` folder. The `static.mp4` file has no moving features and the `dynamic.mp4` file has a couple of moving features 

# Running the code
```
